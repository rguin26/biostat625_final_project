## Project Description
For this project, our group chose to perform statistical analysis using the Clinical Data Set from the Clinical Package of bone marrow cancer data. It was collected from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) genomic data portal. The version of the dataset we used was released by October 29, 2021. The bone marrow cancer can damage the bones, immune system, kidneys, and red blood cell count. The dataset contains 16,029 different cases of bone marrow cancer. We planned on using it for survival analysis and machine learning methodologies.

There are several "Rmd" coding files which were used for practice, and then they were all put together into the "final_report.Rmd" file, which also explains all the steps taken towards the analysis and work involved. The "final_report.Rmd" file was ultimately knitted into a PDF, without any of the code chunks, for the submission of the project.
