# biostat625_final_project

This repository consists of all the work for Group 12 of the Biostatistics 625 Group Project (Fall 2021).

There are several "Rmd" coding files which were used for practice, and then they were all put together into the "final_report.Rmd" file, which also explains all the steps taken towards the analysis and work involved. The "final_report.Rmd" file was ultimately knitted into a PDF, without any of the code chunks, for the submission of the project.
